<h3 align="center">A modern and responsive website for online pizza orders  </h3>

<p align="center">
  This project is a **practice website** designed to simulate an online pizza ordering platform.  
It was developed to improve my skills in **JS and responsive design**, focusing on creating an attractive layout, clean code, and a user-friendly interface.  

🔹 Features:  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Menu section showcasing different pizzas  
- Ordering flow simulation with buttons and layout  
- Clean and modern UI inspired by real pizza delivery websites  

📌 Next steps:  
I plan to return to this project in the future to enhance it with **JavaScript interactivity** (like cart functionality) and also implement **Next.js** and **React** to transform it into a complete and dynamic website with real data handling.
